I never got a solution in fewer than 20 guesses. This does not change depending on the theory that is tested.
The only good thing about this strategy is that it will always eventually find the answer. The bad thing is that
the amount of guesses it takes to find the answer on average is very high and varies dramatically depending on RNG.
